# AI Assistant Animation

This folder should contain your `ai-assistant.riv` file created with Rive.app.

## Quick Setup

We recommend two approaches for adding your animation:

### Option 1: Create a Custom Animation

1. Visit [Rive.app](https://rive.app/) and create an account
2. Create a new Rive file
3. Design your AI assistant character with these states:
   - Greeting (waving/smiling)
   - Thinking (pondering expression)
   - Confused (puzzled look)
   - Celebrating (happy/excited)
4. Set up a State Machine named "State Machine" with a numeric input named "state"
5. Export as "ai-assistant.riv" and place in this folder

### Option 2: Use a Pre-made Animation

1. Download a free robot or character animation from [Rive Community](https://rive.app/community/)
2. Modify it to include the required states and state machine
3. Save as "ai-assistant.riv" in this folder

## Required Animation States

The numeric "state" input should control which animation plays:
- 0: Greeting
- 1: Thinking
- 2: Confused
- 3: Celebrating

## Example Rive Files

Here are some Rive community animations that could work well after modification:
- [Cute Robot](https://rive.app/community/3244-6926-cute-robot/)
- [Robot Character](https://rive.app/community/1317-2606-robot-character/)
- [Robot Dance](https://rive.app/community/179-399-robot-dance/)
